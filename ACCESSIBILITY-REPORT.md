## Fixed Violations

### 1. Color Contrast Issues (SERIOUS) ✅

**Original Violations (3 elements)**:
- Search box placeholder text: 4.42:1 contrast (needed 4.5:1)
- Search keyboard shortcut "⌘K": 4.42:1 contrast (needed 4.5:1)
- Footer "Powered by" text: 3.75:1 contrast (needed 4.5:1)

**Fix Applied**:
Added CSS overrides in `/style.css`:
```css
/* Search text - improved from #949aa2 to #a8aeb6 */
.truncate.min-w-0 {
  color: #a8aeb6 !important;
}

/* Search keyboard shortcut */
.flex-none.text-xs.font-semibold {
  color: #a8aeb6 !important;
}

/* Footer text - improved from #717377 to #8a8d91 */
#footer .items-baseline > span {
  color: #8a8d91 !important;
}
```

**Result**: All color contrast violations eliminated. All text now meets WCAG AA 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio.

## Unfixable Framework Violations

### 2. List Item Semantic Issues (SERIOUS) ⚠️

**Violation**: 2 navbar elements use `<li>` without `<ul>` or `<ol>` parent

**Elements**:
- Support link (`<li class="navbar-link">`)
- Dashboard CTA button (`<li class="whitespace-nowrap hidden lg:flex">`)

**Why Unfixable**:
- Generated by Mintlify's internal navbar rendering
- Not controllable via `docs.json` configuration
- No CSS workaround available
- Would require Mintlify framework update

**Impact**:
- Semantic HTML violation
- Does not affect visual presentation or user experience
- Screen readers can still access the links properly
- Minor impact on assistive technology navigation

### 3. Meta Viewport Zoom Disabled (MODERATE) ⚠️

**Violation**: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">`

**Issue**: `maximum-scale=1` prevents users from zooming on mobile devices

**Why Unfixable**:
- Hardcoded in Mintlify's framework `<head>`
- No configuration option to override
- Not accessible via custom CSS or head injection in free tier

**Impact**:
- Users with low vision cannot pinch-to-zoom on mobile
- Moderate accessibility barrier for mobile users
- Desktop users unaffected (browser zoom still works)
