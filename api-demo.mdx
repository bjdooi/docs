# External API Integration Demo

This page demonstrates how to create custom React components in Mintlify that fetch data from external APIs, handle loading states, and display errors gracefully.

## GitHub User Profile Component

The component below fetches user data from the GitHub API and displays it in a nicely formatted card. It includes:

- **Loading state** - Animated loading indicator while fetching data
- **Error handling** - Clear error messages if the API call fails
- **Responsive design** - Clean, dark-themed UI that matches the site style
- **Real-time data** - Fetches fresh data from GitHub's public API

### Default Example (GitHub organization)

<ExternalDataFetcher />

### Custom User Example

You can specify any GitHub username as a prop:

<ExternalDataFetcher username="torvalds" />

### Another Example

<ExternalDataFetcher username="gaearon" />

## Implementation Details

The component is built with:

- **React Hooks** - `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects
- **Fetch API** - Native browser API for making HTTP requests
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling for failed API calls

### Key Features

<Card title="Loading State" icon="spinner">
  Displays an animated loading indicator while fetching data from the API
</Card>

<Card title="Error Handling" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  Shows user-friendly error messages when API calls fail, including HTTP status codes
</Card>

<Card title="Responsive Design" icon="mobile">
  Adapts to different screen sizes with a clean, modern dark theme
</Card>

<Card title="Dynamic Props" icon="code">
  Accepts username as a prop to fetch any GitHub user's data
</Card>

## Usage in MDX

To use this component in your documentation pages, simply import it and pass the desired username:

```jsx
<ExternalDataFetcher username="yourUsername" />
```

If no username is provided, it defaults to showing the "github" organization profile.

## Code Structure

The component follows best practices for React development:

1. **State Management** - Separate states for data, loading, and errors
2. **Side Effects** - useEffect hook for API calls with proper cleanup
3. **Conditional Rendering** - Different UI for loading, error, and success states
4. **Accessibility** - Semantic HTML and proper alt text for images
5. **Type Safety** - PropTypes or TypeScript can be added for type checking

## API Source

This demo uses the GitHub Users API endpoint:
```
https://api.github.com/users/{username}
```

The API is public and does not require authentication for basic requests, though rate limits apply.

<Note>
  The GitHub API has a rate limit of 60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests. For production use, consider implementing authentication or caching strategies.
</Note>

## Extending This Component

You can extend this pattern to work with any public API:

- **JSONPlaceholder** - For test data and prototyping
- **REST Countries API** - For country information
- **OpenWeather API** - For weather data
- **News API** - For news articles
- **Your own API** - For custom backend integration

<Tip>
  Always handle errors gracefully and provide loading feedback to improve user experience.
